This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Project is hosted in this site: [APP](https://alejoboga20.github.io/gif-expert-app/)

## Concepts

- Use of [GIPHY-API](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/)
- Using props to communicate between components. Adding validations with propTypes.
- useEffect hook to make an http request.
- Destructuring Props.
- Using external helpers for fetching APIs.
- Using [AnimateStyle](https://animate.style/) for CSS Animations
- Use jest fn for mocks. Simulate input change and form submit.
